# About Cyber Digest

This repository supports a text-based cybersecurity channel focused on
cyber news, CVEs simplified, and core security concepts.

The goal is to track the cyber world in real time and explain
vulnerabilities, incidents, and security ideas clearly — without hype,
marketing language, or corporate noise.

All content here is plain-text, signal-driven, and built for learners,
defenders, and curious minds who want to understand how systems fail and
how security actually works.
